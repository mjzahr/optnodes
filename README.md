Tabulated optimization-based nodal distributions over standard finite element geometries generated using the method in J.M. Kaufmann and M.J. Zahr, *Symmetric, optimization-based, cross-element compatible nodal distributions for high-order finite elements*, 2025. Each NPZ file contains 4 entries: `x` a (d, np) Numpy array where the columns contains the coordinates of each node in the distribution and `Mcond`/`lebcnst`/`lebobj` are scalars containing the condition number of the finite element mass matrix, Lebesgue constant, and Lebesgue objective function (detailed in the manuscript) associated with the nodal distribution in `x`. The geometry and polynomial degree of each distribution are indicated in the file name.
